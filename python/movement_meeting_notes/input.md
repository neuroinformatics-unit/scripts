### Present

- Will Graham
- Angela Albi
- Richard Dushime
- Sourabh Kapure
- angkul
- Adam Tyson
- Stella Prins

### Agenda
- Concluding the collaboration with UCL's Advanced Research Computing centre and Sepi Keshavarzi's lab:
- Summary of the spatial navigation features introduced during Jan-Feb 2025
- Upcoming features and bug-fixes for our napari plugin.

### Meeting notes
- New release announcement :tada: 
    - napari, including a guide
    - new plotting functions (centroids and occupancy heatmaps)
    - new examples
- ARC team contributions
    - ROI analyses (defining ROIs, distances, angles)
    - blog post coming
- Sofia updates on Napari
    - bboxes support 
    - tracks layer
    - handle NaNs in points, tracks layers
    - select data to display (e.g. checkbox to select few individuals from all individuals there are available)
- Angela updates
    - movement used in TRex workshops
    - can share google colab analysis notebooks using movement; videos and trajectories available online
        - serve as examples on how she is loading different data "types" (bboxes, kpts, segmentation masks)
    - she uses extra dimensions to handle conditions, events (related [issue](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/movement/issues/418))
        - e.g. of extra dimensions: trials, reps, individuals, day of data acquisition
    - tracklets in trex 
        - what are tracklets?: range of start:end frames with unique ID, i.e. segment of consecutive frames within which the ID likelihood is consistently high; 
        - each individual could have multiple tracklets (there is a video/global tracklet ID, and an individual tracklet ID - if identity is preserved)
        - we will discuss this further offline with her scripts and possibly set up a meeting
    - Tristan (main trex dev) may join next community call
    - YOLO various outputs (segmentation, keypoints, etc.)
        - NS recommends to start with loading YOLO keypoints/centroids (since we have already support for this data types)
        - we are discussing support for segmentation masks (in this [issue](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/movement/issues/301))
- Sepi updates
    - pupillometry example
        - options for filtering
            - Angkul is working into generalising more filter options ([PR](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/movement/pull/455))
            - it is easy for us to support more filters (e.g. high/low pass - we could wrap scipy's [butterworth](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.butter.html))
        - options for removing vibration of the setup
            - using a reference point (like in the pupillometry example)
            - Sepi says they did registration frame by frame too
    - computing head/forward vector example
    - pending example on computing allo/ego angles wrt ROIs (WIP)
        - Will shows the current status
        - Angela mentions it seems easy to support trex export of ROIs (not currently supported but they can make sure)
        - Sepi asks about broadcasting across ROIs
        - Angela mentions other angles that are relevant collective behaviour
            - direction of one animal wrt to direction of another animal
            - angle wrt average of the group
            - we can compute this with current `movement` functionality
    - upcoming blog post summarising ARC work
    - we discuss completion of the wishlist
        - pending path tortuosity and similar metrics
        - pending definition of ROIs in napari
        - pending loading timestamps and support for events (we discussed these in the previous meeting with Sepi)
- CH is replacing our own logging module with loguru
    - adding console handler 
    - keeping file handler
